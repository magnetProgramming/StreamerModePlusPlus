# StreamerMode++ v1.0.0

This mod lets you hide parts of the F3 screen to keep your base or location private while streaming.

You can hide:
- Coordinates  
- Block info  
- Chunk info  
- Facing direction  

You can also change the message that shows when somethingâ€™s hidden.

The default key to open the menu is `-` (minus key), but you can change it in the Controls settings.

Good for anarchy servers or just keeping your spot secret.
